    As a Coach
    In order to leave a note about the students
    I would like to leave a letter of reccomendation

  Background:
    Given the following users exists
            | email              | first_name | last_name | role   | gender | age |
            | alumni_1@craft.com | Student    | One       | member | Male   | 34  |
            | alumni_2@craft.com | Student    | Two       | member | Female | 19  |
            | alumni_3@craft.com |            |           | member | Male   |     |
